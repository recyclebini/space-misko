# GAMEPLAY
In Space Misko, your goal is to destroy as many enemy targets (alien invaders) as possible. You control a rocket using a joystick, moving it left and right across the screen. The targets spawn randomly on the screen, with varying speeds. Each time a target hits an edge of the screen, it moves downwards and increases in speed. To destroy them, press the button to fire a bullet. Each time you're hit, you lose a life point. The game ends when all life points are depleted.
